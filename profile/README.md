#  Welcome to the your-tools organization

This is a place to collaborate on several open source tools.

Everyone is invited to contribute !

## Rules

* Take excellent care of each other.
* Use [optimistic merging](https://dmerej.info/blog/post/optimistic-merging/) 
  (merge first, ask questions later) by default.
* Don't take yourself so seriously ;)
